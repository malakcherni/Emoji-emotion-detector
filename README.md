Emoji Emotion Detector!
OVERVIEW:
This little project is made with teachable machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), a beginner-friendly tool developed by Google.!
I have trained an AI model to distinguish between a happy face and a sad face.
How I built it?
I have collected couple of photos as a set of data. i group of sad faces pictures and a group of happy faces.
I have trained the model and than started testing it using other imajes that i made sure i have not used before in the trainging step.
RESULTS:
- The model was perfectly able to distinguish between happy imojis and sad imojis but unfortuantly it was not able to calssify real human faces
  into happy and sad correctly.
- Test examples:
  - ðŸ˜€ â†’ Predicted as Happy
  - ðŸ˜¢ â†’ Predicted as Sad
TOOLS USED:
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Emojis and facial expression images
- GitHub for version control and documentation
FUTURE PLANS:
-train the model with real human facesa and add more emotions.
